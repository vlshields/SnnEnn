# SnnEnn
********************

## Description

This is a CLI meant to help the user quickly rename Television shows stored on their physical media. It is intended to
rename files based on the recommended naming convention (eg. The Last of Us (2022) S01E01.mkv/mp4). Following this naming
convention should help reduce error when scraping metadata from public databases like TMDB.
